# Medical-Device-NPD-Course
Syllabus (10 Modules)
1) Concept & Feasibility

Goal: Prove clinical value & technical plausibility.

Deliverables: Problem statement, intended use draft, competitive scan, PoC demo, early hazard list.

Artifacts: /docs/URS/00_problem_brief.md, /hardware/proof_of_concept/.

2) User Requirements (URS)

Goal: Capture user needs & workflow.

Deliverables: URS, use cases, primary operating functions, usability goals.

Artifacts: /docs/URS/URS.md, /usability/use_scenarios.md.

3) Design Inputs

Goal: Translate URS â†’ measurable, testable requirements (functional, safety, regulatory).

Deliverables: Design Input Document (DID), standards mapping table.

Artifacts: /docs/design_inputs/DID.md.

4) Design & Development (Architecture + Prototyping)

Goal: System architecture; alpha prototypes (HW/SW/mech).

Deliverables: Block diagrams, schematics, firmware/app skeleton, enclosure v1.

Artifacts: /hardware/alpha/, /software/alpha/, /docs/DHF/architecture.md.

5) Design Verification

Goal: Show outputs meet inputs.

Deliverables: Verification Plan, test protocols, bench results, traceability updates.

Artifacts: /verif_validation/verification_plan.md, /verif_validation/protocols/.

6) Design Validation (User Needs & Intended Use)

Goal: Validate with representative users/environment; usability testing (IEC 62366).

Deliverables: Validation Plan/Report, formative & summative usability results.

Artifacts: /usability/formative/, /usability/summative/, /verif_validation/validation_report.md.

7) Design Transfer

Goal: Prepare controlled manufacturing.

Deliverables: DMR (BOM, drawings, specs), work instructions, training records.

Artifacts: /manufacturing/DMR/, /manufacturing/work_instructions/.

8) Regulatory Submission

Goal: Assemble clearance/approval dossier outline (e.g., 510(k) style index).

Deliverables: Indications for Use, Substantial Equivalence narrative (if 510(k)), risk/benefit summary.

Artifacts: /docs/regulatory/510k_index.md (or EU MDR dossier outline).

9) Production & Process Validation

Goal: Validate processes (IQ/OQ/PQ), define QC.

Deliverables: Process validation protocols/reports, incoming/in-process/final QC plans.

Artifacts: /manufacturing/validation/IQ_OQ_PQ/, /manufacturing/QC_plans/.

10) Post-Market Surveillance & Continuous Improvement

Goal: Monitor field performance; close the loop via CAPA.

Deliverables: PMS plan, complaint/CAPA workflow, PSUR/PMSR template.
